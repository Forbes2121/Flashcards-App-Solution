# Flashcards-App-Solution

Flashcard-o-matic is an application intended for both teachers to use to create decks of flashcards for the subjects they teach, as well as for students to use to study the decks their teachers have created.

# Installation

- Fork and clone this repository.
- Run <b>npm install</b> to install project dependencies.
- Run <b>npm run start</b> to concurrently start the project's frontend and backend.

# Note

The app was fully working on my machine and in Qualified (minus the bootstrap), fingers crossed it works for you as well!
